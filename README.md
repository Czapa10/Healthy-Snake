# Introduction
This project was my attempt to write "clean" object oriented code.
(From my next projects I learnt that oop is not very efficient way of programming. Now I'm fan of data oriented design and I dislike oop quite strongly.)

# Goals

- make more interesting version of snake game 
- promote healthy food
